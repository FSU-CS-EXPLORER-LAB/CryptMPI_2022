/*
 * When an application needs to register memory, it
 * calls dreg_register. The application does not keep 
 * track of what has already been registered. This is
 * tracked inside the dreg interface. 
 * 
 * dreg stores dreg entries in a hash table for 
 * easy lookup. The table is indexed by a dreg 
 * page number (the dreg page size may be unrelated
 * to the machine page size, but is a power of two). 
 * 
 * The hash table size is DREG_HASHSIZE. Collisions
 * are handled by chaining through the "next" field
 * in dreg_entry. New entries are placed at the head
 * of the chain. 
 *
 * Registrations are reference-counted. An application 
 * is responsible for pairing dreg_register/unregister
 * calls. 
 * 
 * When the reference count reaches zero, the dreg_entry is moved to
 * the end of the hash chain (xxx this is NOT clearly the right
 * thing. For now, leave it where it is and see how it works) and also
 * placed on the unused_list (it is now on two lists instead of
 * one). Associated memory * is *not* unregistered with VIA, 
 * but is a candidate for VIA unregistration if needed. The
 * unused list is a doubly linked list so that entries can be removed
 * from the middle of the list if an application registration request
 * comes along before memory is actually unregistered. Also, the list
 * is FIFO rather than LIFO (e.g. it has both a tail and a head) so
 * that only entries that have been on the list a long time become
 * candidates for VIA deregistration. 
 * 
 * In summary, there are three lists.
 *  - the dreg free list. pool of dreg structures from which 
 *    we grab new dreg entries as needed. LIFO (head only) for
 *    cache reuse. Singly linked through next field in dreg_entry
 * 
 *  - hash list chain. When there is a hash collision, entries
 *    with the same hash are placed on this list. It is singly
 *    linked through the next field in dreg_entry. New entries
 *    are placed at the head of the list. Because the list is
 *    singly linked, removing an entry from the middle is potentially
 *    expensive. However, hash lists should be short, and the only 
 *    time we remove an entry is if it has zero ref count and we 
 *    have to unregister its memory. 
 *  
 *  - unused list. This is the list of dreg entries that represent
 *    registered memory, but the application is not currently using 
 *    this memory. Rather than deregister memory when the refcount
 *    goes to zero, we put it on the unused list. If resources 
 *    become scarce and we have to unregister memory, it is easy to
 *    find entries with zero ref count. 
 *    NOTE adding/removing entries to/from unused list is a critical
 *    path item that will happen all the time. Also,
 *    the need to find a unused item is very rare, and is associated
 *    with a VIA deregistration/registration. So why do we want
 *    the unused list? It is an LRU device that ensures that only
 *    memory that has not been used for a while will be freed. 
 *    This avoids a serious thrashing scenario. 
 *    xxx consider deleting/replacing unused list later on. 
 */

/* LAZY_MEM_UNREGISTER, enabled, will not un-register memory
 * after the ref-count drops to zero, rather the entry will
 * be put on the unused list in case the memory is to be
 * used again.  These are the semantics described above.
 * This can be a problem if the virtual to physical mapping
 * gets changed between calls.
 * By undefining this macro, we revert to semantics in which
 * memory is unregistered when the ref_count drops to zero.
 * In this case, the unused list should always be empty.
 *
 * NOTE: If not doing RDMA operations, we (MVICH layer)
 * controls all registered memory (VBUFs) and we don't
 * have to worry about the address translation getting
 * changed.
