The MVAPICH2 software, based on MPI 3.1 standard, delivers the best performance,
scalability and fault tolerance for high-end computing systems and servers using
InfiniBand, Omni-Path, Ethernet/iWARP, and RoCE networking technologies.
MVAPICH2 provides underlying support for several interfaces (such as OFA-IB,
OFA-iWARP, OFA-RoCE, CH3-PSM, CH3-PSM2, Shared Memory, and TCP) for portability
across multiple networks.

This package uses the basic GNU build system.  To install a default build of
MVAPICH2 from the release tarball you can issue the following commands:

    ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/mvapich2
    make            # make -j<num threads> for parallel build
    make install    

The latest MVAPICH2 release tarball can be downloaded from:
